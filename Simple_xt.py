===============
Expected threat
===============

This example shows how to create an expected threat (xT) model. Expected threat is a method
for valuing the likelihood of scoring with possession of the ball at
a position on the football pitch.

Expected threat is based on `Markov chains <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain>`_.
The main assumption for modelling soccer in this way is the probability of scoring
only depends on the current action, it is memoryless, and it does not consider what
happened before or after the event. Often in soccer, this isn't a fair assumption as attacks
may form quickly on the counter or due to pressuring the opponent high up the field. In
reality how an action came about and how the defence is shifted
may have an impact on what happens next.

I recommend reading through this excellent
`blog post <https://soccermatics.medium.com/explaining-expected-threat-cbc775d97935>`_ by
`David Sumpter (@soccermatics) <https://twitter.com/Soccermatics>`_ on the history of expected
threat, its limitations, and possible extensions.

The first use of Markov chains to evaluate the probability of scoring was by
`Sarah Rudd <https://twitter.com/srudd_ok>`_ in their
`conference presentation <http://nessis.org/nessis11/rudd.pdf>`_ "a framework for tactical
analysis and individual offensive production assessment in soccer using Markov chains." Although
not named expected threat it contained many of the ideas used here.
`Karun Singh <https://twitter.com/karun1710>`_ then popularised and named the idea
in their `fantastic interactive blog post <https://karun.in/blog/expected-threat.html>`_. In this
tutorial, we model expected threat using Karun's ideas in the blog post.

# --------------
# Get event data from the FA Women's Super League 2019/20.
